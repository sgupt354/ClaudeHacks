## 🧩 The Problem

> *Maria walks past the same broken streetlight every night. It's been dark for six weeks. Her neighbor's kid nearly got hit by a car last month.*
>
> *She wants to report it — but she doesn't know who to call. She doesn't speak English fluently. She doesn't know what department handles streetlights, or how to write a formal complaint.*
>
> *So she does nothing. The light stays broken.*

This is the **civic participation gap**. It's not apathy — it's friction. And it hits hardest on people who are already underserved: non-English speakers, first-generation residents, anyone who's never had to navigate government bureaucracy.

The people who need their government to listen the most are the ones least equipped to make it happen.

**Civilian exists to close that gap.**

## ✨ How It Works

```
You describe the problem  →  AI does the rest  →  Community amplifies it
```

**1. Describe it in plain language** — in any of 70+ languages, as casually as you want.

**2. AI finds the right official** — Claude searches the web for the real, current responsible official in your city, looks up the actual municipal codes that apply, and writes a formal professional complaint letter on your behalf.

**3. Community rallies behind you** — Your issue is posted to a public feed. Neighbors who've seen the same pothole, the same broken light, the same unsafe crosswalk can echo your complaint. One voice is easy to ignore. Fifty voices from the same neighborhood is a pattern that demands a response.

---

## 🌍 Real World Impact

Every complaint submitted through Civilian:

| What happens | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Goes to a **named, real official** | Not a generic inbox that gets ignored |
| Cites the **specific city ordinance** being violated | Officials can't claim ignorance |
| Shows a **community echo count** | Turns individual frustration into collective pressure |
| Is **publicly visible** | Creates transparency and accountability |
| Can be **marked resolved** | Closes the loop — residents see results |

When ten people echo the same pothole report, it signals a neighborhood problem. The urgency score rises. The issue becomes harder to deprioritize.

## ⚖️ Ethics & Fairness

Civilian was built with a deliberate commitment to not making existing inequalities worse.

**🌐 Language equity** — 70+ languages supported. A resident who speaks Somali, Gujarati, or Haitian Creole gets the same access as an English speaker. The language barrier is removed entirely.

**⚖️ No bias in routing** — The AI finds officials based on location and issue type, not who the user is. A complaint from a low-income neighborhood gets the same quality letter and the same official contact as one from an affluent area.

**🛡️ Intent-based moderation, not keyword policing** — The system understands that a frustrated resident venting about a dangerous road is not the same as someone being abusive. It asks one question: *is this message appropriate to send to a government official?* Legitimate civic frustration passes. Actual abuse doesn't.

**🔒 No personal data required** — No accounts, no sign-ups. The barrier to participation is as low as possible.

**🔓 Fail-open design** — If any AI service is unavailable, the system defaults to allowing the complaint through. Civic participation is never silently blocked by a technical failure.
